Ingredients:

1 cup white rice (long-grain or medium-grain)
2 cups water
1 tablespoon butter or olive oil (optional)
Salt to taste


Instructions:
Rinse the Rice: Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from being too sticky.

Boil Water: In a saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.

Add Rice: Once the water is boiling, add the rinsed rice to the pot.

Season: If desired, add a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of butter or olive oil for flavor.

Simmer: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer for about 18-20 minutes. Cooking times may vary depending on the type of rice, so check the package instructions.

Fluff: After the allotted time, turn off the heat and let the rice sit, covered, for an additional 5 minutes. Then, use a fork to fluff the rice gently, separating the grains.

Serve: Your simple and fluffy white rice is ready to be served as a side dish or as a base for other recipes.
